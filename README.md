This project is a Car Service System developed using Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL, utilizing JDBC for database connectivity. The system allows users to schedule car service appointments, manage customer information, and track service history. With a user-friendly interface, the application ensures seamless interaction between clients and service providers. The backend is powered by Java, which handles business logic and data manipulation, while the frontend is crafted with HTML and CSS for an intuitive user experience. The SQL database effectively manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring the system is efficient and reliable. This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development and my ability to create functional, database-driven applications.
